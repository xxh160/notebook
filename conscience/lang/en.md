2. robust
3. incremental
    - Gradle’s incremental build support is robust and reliable.
4. gossip
5. glossary
6. crucial
7. declarative
8. paradigm
    - In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
9. imperative
    - It’s easy to end up with a build script that mixes declarative DSL elements with imperative, procedural code.
    - Well-designed build scripts consist mostly of declarative configuration rather than imperative logic.
10. implication
    - It’s important for every build script developer to understand the different phases of the build lifecycle and their implications on performance and evaluation order of build logic.  
11. synchronization
12. condense
13. skeleton
14. nested
15. toggle
    - Little arrows to the left of the HTML elements allow you to toggle the view of nested elements.
16. opinionated
17. streamline
    - React also streamlines how data is stored and handled, using state and props.
18. involute
    - The moves in cheess are not only maniford, but involute.

#### 10

1. interior
   - RIP v1 is considered as an classful interior geteway protocol.
2. metric
   - RIP is a distance vector protocol that uses a hop count metric.
3. administrative
   - The lesser the administrative distance value the reliability is much more.
4. scalable
   - Is is scalable across a range of systems.
5. autonomous
   - An interior gateway protocol (IGP) is a type of protocol used for exchanging routing information between gateways (commonly routers) within an autonomous system (for example, a system of corporate local area networks)
6. alphabet

#### 11

1. invasively
   - Spring enables you to build applications from “plain old Java objects” (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs.
2. lightweight
3. cohesive
   - In the Java community there's been a rush of lightweight containers that help to assemble components from different projects into a cohesive application.
4. stab
   - A number of frameworks have taken a stab at this problem,, and several are branching out to provide a general capability to assemble components from different layers.
5. terminology
6. knotty
   - The topic of wiring elements together drags me almost immediately into the knotty terminology problems that surround the terms service and component.
7. opinionated
   - Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.
8. stunningly
   - This stunningly useful function is implemented by a single method.
9. scaffolding
10. decouple

#### 12

1. segregated
   - Using a Segregated Interface for the Locator.
2. amenable
3. exacerbate
4. intrusive
   - Of course the testing problem is exacerbated by component environments that are very intrusive, such as Java's EJB framework.
5. inheritance
   - If you have multiple constructors and inheritance, then things can get particularly awkward.
6. polymorphism
   - It's something we see within an object-oriented program when conditional logic decides which class to instantiate, and then future evaluations of that conditional are done through polymorphism rather than through duplicated conditional code.
7. defer
   - The first question is whether you wish to defer the choice of implementation class to particular deployments.
8. conflate
   - Her letter conflate past and present.
9. coherent
   - Although the Java platform provides a wealth of application development functionality, it lacks the means to organize the basic building blocks into a coherent whole, leaving that task to architects and developers.
10. sophisticated
    - The BeanFactory is a sophisticated implementation of the factory pattern.

#### 15

1. sketch
   - Here is a sketch of class Enum.

#### 17

1. tangible
   - A domain object is a tangible or intangible business entity abstracted from the real world.

#### 22

1. streamline
   - React also streamlines how data is stored and handled, using state and props.
2. mandatory
